# How-To Create a PR (Delete this section before saving PR)
1. Add a descriptive title
2. Add a description
   -  Quickly explain what you did 
   - **Must include:** *closes #[issueNumber]* (this will auto link the PR to the issue and close it after PR is merged)
3. Make sure all Sonar Cloud issues are resolved
4. Make sure the GitHub Pipeline checks are all successful
5. Make sure you tested your change locally and it works as expected
6. After your PR is ready assign someone  in the "Reviewer" field, you can also add 2 people if you think it make sense for your change
7. After the review is done
   - If there are no changes requested and the PR is approved you can continue with step 7
   - If there are change requests, do them, push the branch and start again from step 3 and add a comment tagging the reviewer, letting him know you did all requested changes
8. Merge your PR
9. Add a comment tagging @Testing team where you explain how your change can be tested and if possible, include a URL directly to the feature on the TEST System
